I am a PhD student at <a href="https://insait.ai/">INSAIT</a>, <a href="https://www.uni-sofia.bg/">Sofia University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://insait.ai/prof-luc-van-gool/">Luc Van Gool</a>.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in teaching computers to understand and generate visual worlds — from videos to interactive environments.

My current research  involves vision-based generative modeling with an emphasis on control and interaction. I am interested in world models, controllable video synthesis/editing and data-driven simulators generalizing across many environments.

In the past, I have extensively worked on face analysis and synthesis topics - including deepfake generation and detection, age and expression estimation, face relighting, etc. I have also provided supervision for UvA Master AI students for their computer vision Master's thesis projects.

Previously, I finished the Artificial Intelligence Master’s at the University of Amsterdam with honors, and a Computer Science Bachelor's degree at Sofia University, Bulgaria at the top of the class.
